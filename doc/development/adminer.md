## The application and logs database are separated and accessible via Adminer

### Go to http://localhost:8080 and log in with the following credentials (generally we want to go to `database`, which is the app's database):

| Field     | Value                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------|
| System    | PostgreSQL                      |
| Server    | db                              |
| Username  | superadmin                      |
